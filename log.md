# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 5th Jan, 2016
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Signed up to a few new online services including codewars and freecodecamp - made a program to find the highest and lowest numbers in a list using python

**Thoughts:** I finished codeacademy's python course about three weeks ago and haven't done any coding since. I had forgotten a lot of what i'd learned and found the task challenging. I had to google a lot of basic syntax.
